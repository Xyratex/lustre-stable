/** \defgroup fid fid
 *
 * @{
 *
 * http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/Architecture_-_Interoperability_fids_zfs
 * describes the FID namespace and interoperability requirements for FIDs.
 * The important parts of that document are included here for reference.
 *
 * FID
 *   File IDentifier generated by client from range allocated by the SEQuence
 *   service and stored in struct lu_fid. The FID is composed of three parts:
 *   SEQuence, ObjectID, and VERsion.  The SEQ component is a filesystem
 *   unique 64-bit integer, and only one client is ever assigned any SEQ value.
 *   The first 0x400 FID_SEQ_NORMAL [2^33, 2^33 + 0x400] values are reserved
 *   for system use.  The OID component is a 32-bit value generated by the
 *   client on a per-SEQ basis to allow creating many unique FIDs without
 *   communication with the server.  The VER component is a 32-bit value that
 *   distinguishes between different FID instantiations, such as snapshots or
 *   separate subtrees within the filesystem.  FIDs with the same VER field
 *   are considered part of the same namespace.
 *
 * OLD filesystems are those upgraded from Lustre 1.x that predate FIDs, and
 *   MDTs use 32-bit ldiskfs internal inode/generation numbers (IGIFs), while
 *   OSTs use 64-bit Lustre object IDs and generation numbers.
 *
 * NEW filesystems are those formatted since the introduction of FIDs.
 *
 * IGIF
 *   Inode and Generation In FID, a surrogate FID used to globally identify
 *   an existing object on OLD formatted MDT file system. This would only be
 *   used on MDT0 in a DNE filesystem, because there cannot be more than one
 *   MDT in an OLD formatted filesystem. Belongs to sequence in [12, 2^32 - 1]
 *   range, where inode number is stored in SEQ, and inode generation is in OID.
 *   NOTE: This assumes no more than 2^32-1 inodes exist in the MDT filesystem,
 *   which is the maximum possible for an ldiskfs backend.  It also assumes
 *   that the reserved ext3/ext4/ldiskfs inode numbers [0-11] are never visible
 *   to clients, which has always been true.
 *
 * IDIF
 *   object ID In FID, a surrogate FID used to globally identify an existing
 *   OST object on OLD formatted OST file system. Belongs to a sequence in
 *   [2^32, 2^33 - 1]. Sequence number is calculated as:
 *
 *      1 << 32 | (ost_index << 16) | ((objid >> 32) & 0xffff)
 *
 *   that is, SEQ consists of 16-bit OST index, and higher 16 bits of object
 *   ID. The generation of unique SEQ values per OST allows the IDIF FIDs to
 *   be identified in the FLD correctly. The OID field is calculated as:
 *
 *      objid & 0xffffffff
 *
 *   that is, it consists of lower 32 bits of object ID.  For objects within
 *   the IDIF range, object ID extraction will be:
 *
 *      o_id = (fid->f_seq & 0x7fff) << 16 | fid->f_oid;
 *      o_seq = 0;  // formerly group number
 *
 *   NOTE: This assumes that no more than 2^48-1 objects have ever been created
 *   on any OST, and that no more than 65535 OSTs are in use.  Both are very
 *   reasonable assumptions, i.e. an IDIF can uniquely map all objects assuming
 *   a maximum creation rate of 1M objects per second for a maximum of 9 years,
 *   or combinations thereof.
 *
 * OST_MDT0
 *   Surrogate FID used to identify an existing object on OLD formatted OST
 *   filesystem. Belongs to the reserved SEQuence 0, and is used prior to
 *   the introduction of FID-on-OST, at which point IDIF will be used to
 *   identify objects as residing on a specific OST.
 *
 * LLOG
 *   For Lustre Log objects the object sequence 1 is used. This is compatible
 *   with both OLD and NEW namespaces, as this SEQ number is in the
 *   ext3/ldiskfs reserved inode range and does not conflict with IGIF
 *   sequence numbers.
 *
 * ECHO
 *   For testing OST IO performance the object sequence 2 is used. This is
 *   compatible with both OLD and NEW namespaces, as this SEQ number is in
 *   the ext3/ldiskfs reserved inode range and does not conflict with IGIF
 *   sequence numbers.
 *
 * OST_MDT1 .. OST_MAX
 *   For testing with multiple MDTs the object sequence 3 through 9 is used,
 *   allowing direct mapping of MDTs 1 through 7 respectively, for a total
 *   of 8 MDTs including OST_MDT0. This matches the legacy CMD project "group"
 *   mappings. However, this SEQ range is only for testing prior to any
 *   production DNE release, as the objects in this range conflict across all
 *   OSTs, as the OST index is not part of the FID.  For production DNE usage,
 *   OST objects created by MDT1+ will use FID_SEQ_NORMAL FIDs.
 *
 * DLM OST objid to IDIF mapping
 *   For compatibility with existing OLD OST network protocol structures, the
 *   FID must map onto the o_id and o_seq in a manner that ensures existing
 *   objects are identified consistently for IO, as well as onto the LDLM
 *   namespace to ensure IDIFs there is only a single resource name for any
 *   object in the DLM.  The OLD OST object DLM resource mapping is:
 *
 *      resource[] = {o_id, o_seq, 0, 0}; // o_seq == 0 for production releases
 *
 *   The NEW OST object DLM resource mapping is the same for both MDT and OST:
 *
 *      resource[] = {SEQ, OID, VER, HASH};
 *
 *  NOTE: for mapping IDIF values to DLM resource names the o_id may be
 *  larger than the 2^33 reserved sequence numbers for IDIF, so it is possible
 *  for the o_id numbers to overlap FID SEQ numbers in the resource. However,
 *  in all production releases the OLD o_seq field is always zero, and all
 *  valid FID OID values are non-zero, so the lock resources will not collide.
 *  Even so, the MDT and OST resources are also in different LDLM namespaces.
